## Tasks and Outputs

### 1. **EIS Measurements: 3D Plot**
- Generated a 3D plot showing Impedance (Re(Z), Im(Z)) vs. Cycle Count.
- This visualization highlights changes in impedance values with aging.

### 2. **Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA)**
- Created plots of `dQ/dV` vs. Voltage to analyze capacity changes during charge/discharge cycles.
- Extended this analysis to visualize how ICA peaks evolve with aging.

### 3. **Machine Learning Model**
- Developed a Linear Regression model to predict current battery capacity from EIS measurements.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
